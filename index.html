<p>Pi, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, and this is just the beginning; it keeps on going, forever, without ever repeating. Which means that contained within this string of decimals, is every single other number. Your birth date, combination to your locker, your social security number, it's all in there, somewhere. And if you convert these decimals into letters, you would have every word that ever existed in every possible combination; the first syllable you spoke as a baby, the name of your latest crush, your entire life story from beginning to end, everything we ever say or do; all of the world’s infinite possibilities rest within this one simple circle. Now what you do with that information; what it's good for, well that would be up to you.</p>
<p>π是圆周长和其直径的比，3.1415926535只是一个开始，后面一直会有，无穷无尽，而且绝不重复。这就说明在3.1415926535这串数字之中包含各种可能的组合，你的生日，储物柜的密码，社保账号都在其中的某处。如果将这些小数转换为字母，可以得到现有的及可能有的存在的每一个单词。你婴儿时期发出的第一个音节，你上一个恋人的名字，你整个生命历程从开始至结束，我们做过的或说过的人和事，宇宙中所有无限的可能都在简单的圆里。用这些信息做什么，它能有什么用，这都取决于你自己。</p>
